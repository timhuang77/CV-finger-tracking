# CV-finger-tracking
This repo is the final project assignment for my introduction to computer vision course at my university. The objective of this project is to perform finger-tracking of the subject individual's finger. This is a merely pedagogical exercise as there are far more advanced techniques for performing object tracking that are much more robust and reliable than the techniques used here. However, these techniques provide the foundation and basics for computer vision problems and are quite educational. 

These are the following techniques employed in this exercise:
* Image segmentation
* Image back-projection
* Noise-reduction via connected-component labeling
* 2D histogram generation
* Contour & edge-finding

## Packages
* OpenCV v3.4.3.18
* Numpy v1.15.4
* Matplotlib v3.0.2
* SciPy v1.1.0

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Python IDE
